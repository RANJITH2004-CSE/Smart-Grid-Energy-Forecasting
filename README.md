# Multi-Region Smart Grid Energy Demand Forecasting

## 🌿 Overview
This project uses a **Stacked LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network to predict electricity demand for regional smart grids. By accurately forecasting peaks, we can enable **Peak Shaving** to reduce CO2 emissions.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Cyber-Physical System:** Integrates real-world energy data with deep learning.
- **Sustainability Impact:** Potential to prevent over **4.5 Million kg of CO2** emissions.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of **221.21 MW**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Environment:** Google Colab / Kaggle API

## 📊 Results
Our AI model tracks actual demand almost perfectly (see graph in the notebook).# Smart-Grid-Energy-Forecasting
